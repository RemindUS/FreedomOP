'FreedomOP Post archives' is project created by myself, [zD12](https://github.com/zD12) and my dear friend, [zdb12](https://github.com/zdb12) to better understand how many posts are posted on [FreedomOP's public forum](http://to.fop.us.to/info).

We're using [ProBoards](http://proboards.com) public RSS connected to [IFTTT (if this then that)](http://ifttt.com) to automaticially submit issues including the URL of the content/thread, and the date of posting.   Upon obtaining that information we submit it to our source code.


I don't plan on making a profit (if I could, I would), nor do I plan on gaining any debt.   This project is completely due our stupidity, educational, and analytics reasons, however, our reasoning may change at any time.
